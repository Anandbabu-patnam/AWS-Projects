**1.AWS VPC with Public and Private Subnets in Production**

VPC Design and Implementation: Designed a VPC with public subnets (NAT gateways and load balancers) and private subnets (servers managed by Auto Scaling) across two Availability Zones.

Traffic Management: Set up a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic to servers in private subnets; enabled internet access for private subnets via NAT gateways.

Performance and Security: Managed VPC components ensuring high availability, compliance with AWS best practices, and enhanced security measures.
